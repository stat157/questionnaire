Stat 157 Questionnaire Data Wrangling
=====================================

You'll need to follow these steps on your virtual machine to do data
wrangling for this assignment:

    sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook python-pip
    pip install gspread

Once you have these dependencies installed you can start the ipython notebook:

    ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0

Then copy the example config file to your home directory, but named
`stat157.cfg` like this:

    cp example.cfg ~/stat157.cfg

Edit the example config file `~/stat157.cfg` with:

    vi ~/stat157.cfg

NOTE: Do **NOT** put your actual password into example.cfg! And
definitely **DO NOT** check it into github!
